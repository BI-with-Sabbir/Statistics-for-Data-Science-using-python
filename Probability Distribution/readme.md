# 🎲 Probability Distributions & Random Variables

This project notebook explores fundamental probability concepts and distributions using Python. It is designed to help learners understand both **mathematical theory** and **practical simulation** using code and visualizations.

## 📌 Topics Covered

### 🎯 Random Variables
A **random variable** is a variable whose possible values are outcomes of a random phenomenon.  
- **Discrete** random variables take countable values (e.g., number of heads in coin tosses).  
- **Continuous** random variables can take any value in a range (e.g., height, weight).

### 🎲 Law of Large Numbers
This law states that as an experiment is repeated many times, the average of the results approaches the expected value.  
**Example:** When rolling a fair die many times, the average outcome tends toward 3.5.

---

### 📊 Expected Value and Variance
- **Expected Value (Mean):** The long-run average value of repetitions of the experiment.  
  🧮 `E[X] = Σ p(x) * x` for discrete random variables  
- **Variance:** Measures the spread of values around the mean.  
  🧮 `Var(X) = E[(X - μ)^2]`

### 📈 Discrete Probability Distributions

#### Binomial Distribution
Used for scenarios with two outcomes (success/failure) repeated `n` times.  
👉 Example: Flipping a coin 10 times.

#### Poisson Distribution
Models the number of events happening in a fixed interval of time or space.  
👉 Example: Number of emails received per hour.

---

### 🔁 Continuous Probability Distributions

#### Normal Distribution
A bell-shaped curve, symmetric about the mean. Most natural phenomena follow this distribution.  
👉 Example: Heights, test scores.

#### Exponential Distribution
Models the time between events in a Poisson process.  
👉 Example: Time until next customer arrives at a service point.

### ⚙️ Moments and Distribution Properties
- **Mean (1st moment):** Central location  
- **Variance (2nd moment):** Spread  
- **Skewness (3rd moment):** Asymmetry of distribution  
- **Kurtosis (4th moment):** Tail thickness

These statistical moments help describe and understand the shape and behavior of distributions.
